# AskMate



This is a webpage where users can exchange information by asking questions and writing comments. Furthermore, this is my very first project to learn the basics of web development. My Team and I were working on this for 3 weeks and our high motivation lasted until the end, as this project was really enjoyable. I participated in the development on the server and on the client side as well. It is an important project in my journey of learning in Codecool.

## Tech Stack

**Client:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

**Server:** Python, Flask
